                in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having

            <p>“Imagination is tapping into the subconscious in a form of open play. 
                That is why art or music therapy, which encourages a person to take up brushes 
                and paint or an instrument, and just express themselves, is so powerful.”

            <h3>Music for Every Mood</h3>
            <p>Positive emotions dominate musical experiences. Pleasurable music may lead to 
                the release of neurotransmitters associated with reward, such as dopamine. 
                Listening to music is an easy way to alter mood or relieve stress. 
                People use music in their everyday lives to regulate, enhance, and diminish 
                undesirable emotional states (e.g., stress, fatigue).

            <h3>Music and Expression</h3>
            <p>Music is a strong form of expression, and through music many emotions can be 
                shown whether that be happy, sad, or angry . Music gives you the opportunity to 
                express yourself without using words of your own instead the emotions of a 
                complex song or a simple love song to do so. In doing this you are able to 
                release all the feelings you have for that period of time that song is on, 
                and feel like all those emotions are being played out throughout the song. 
                You can play a song, and it can have the same situation you are going through, 
                and you feel a sense of relief. It helps you understand that in that moment you 
                can feel like there is something that can help you relate to what is going on in 
                your life. Music gives you the chance to release things, and feel things that you 
                wouldn’t be able to without it. It makes you sad or happy through the first couple 
                of seconds listening to the piece.
