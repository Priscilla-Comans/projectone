            <h3>Lyric Quote</h3>
            <p>“Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware <br>
                But I'd rather be a real nightmare, than die unaware, yeah <br>
                Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware <br>
                But I'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers” <br>

            <h3>Mental Health Awareness</h3>
            <p>"I've been committed twice since [I became] Halsey, and no one's known about it. But I'm not ashamed of talking about it now," the singer told Rolling Stone about in-patient mental health treatment she's received. "It's been my choice. I've said to [my manager], 'Hey, I'm not going to do anything bad right now, but I'm getting to the point where I'm scared that I might, so I need to go figure this out.' It's still happening in my body. I just know when to get in front of it." - <span style="color: blue;">CNN</span> <br>
