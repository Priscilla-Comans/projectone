            <h3>Style Of Music</h3>
            <p> Feuerstein has credited Eminem as his prime influence in hip hop, claiming that at one point that was all he listened to. NF's style has also been compared to Logic and Machine Gun Kelly. Although he found his musical upbringing in Christian hip-hop, Feuerstein has denied his label as a Christian rapper, saying "I'm a Christian, but I don't make Christian music. You're not going to reach everyone with just one point of view. I write about things I'm actually dealing with. You don't have to be Christian to relate to them."
            </p>
            <P>In 2013, Feuerstein appeared on Christian hip-hop artist Flame's album Royal Flush on the track "Start Over". In 2015, his feature on TobyMac's This Is Not a Test track "Til the Day I Die" gained him fame and recognition in the Christian hip-hop genre. Feuerstein's 2017 collaboration with Futuristic, "Epiphany", enhanced his career in the secular rap industry. <span style="color: blue;">- Wikipedia</span></P>

            <h4>Control Lyrics</h4>
            <p>"I made an album but that shit was garbage <br>
                Yo, I was trapped in a gimmick <br>
                I finally get it <br>
                I'm here to make music that matters <br>
                If I die, it'll all be alright <br>
                'Cause the message I gave you will live for me after <br>
                And my chapter will highlight a lifetime (Lifetime) <br>
                Of energy gave through a bright mind (Bright mind)" <br> -

            <h3>Christian Background</h3>
            <br> 
            <p>NF's lyrics routinely share his relationship with God.

                In one song he proclaims, "I don't live for the world. I live for the king. I live for the king."
                
                The Michigan native uses his music to open up about the pain in his life, from his parents' divorce to the day his mother died from an overdose.
                
                In a freestyle rap called "Rhyme and Reason - Real," NF talks a bit about his faith journey and how God has given him rap to help him along the way. <span>-CBN</span>
