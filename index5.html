            <p>I just need some time, I'm tryna think straight <br>

            <p>You were a vision in the morning when the light came through <br>
                I know I've only felt religion when i've lied with you <br>
                You said you'll never be forgiven till your boys are too <br>
                And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you</p>
